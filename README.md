# PokéStrings - English

**DOWNLOAD**: [Click this to download](../../archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

PokéMMO custom strings to skip or shorten dialogue. Does not remove PokéMMO strings. Supports [Gilan's Ecnounter Counter](https://forums.pokemmo.com/index.php?/topic/137452-tool-gilans-encounter-counter-beta-available-v103-update/).

**Disclaimer**: I removed "!HORDE!" to support GEC without breaking PokeMMO's core strings. I did some testing and it seems to pause the game the same amount of time regardless of what you spell out.

## Install

1. Set language in-game to English
2. Close PokeMMO
3. Remove any custom strings you have for English (en) from `...\PokeMMO\data\strings`
4. Unzip the PokeStrings Folder
5. Copy **ONLY** and **ALL** the XML files to your `...\PokeMMO\data\strings` folder
	- yes even the placeholder one
