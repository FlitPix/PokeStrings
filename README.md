# PokéStrings - English

**DOWNLOAD**: [Click this to download](../../archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

This [PokéStrings](https://github.com/rudes/PokeStrings) fork is meant to speed up gameplay by shortening or removing strings, while still preserving the story mode as much as possible. It's mostly tailored to my preference. The base repo supports [Gilan's Ecnounter Counter](https://forums.pokemmo.com/index.php?/topic/137452-tool-gilans-encounter-counter-beta-available-v103-update/), but I don't personally use it and don't test my changes with it.

## Install

**Disclaimer**: This pack does not create a new language option it uses the default English option.

1. Set language in-game to English
2. Close PokeMMO
3. Remove any custom strings you have for English (en) from `...\PokeMMO\data\strings`
4. Unzip the PokeStrings Folder
5. Copy **ONLY** and **ALL** the XML files to your `...\PokeMMO\data\strings` folder
	- yes even the placeholder one
6. **MAC USERS** rename the file `zz_strings_en_PokeStrings.xml` to `strings-mac.xml`
