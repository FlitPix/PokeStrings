# PokéStrings - English

**DOWNLOAD**: [Click here to download](../../archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

This [PokéStrings](https://github.com/rudes/PokeStrings) fork is meant to speed up gameplay by shortening or removing strings. It's mostly tailored to my preference.

## Install

Note that, like many other custom string packs, this modifies existing language settings rather than creating a new language option.

1. Set the language in-game to English. Other languages are not supported at this time.
2. Exit PokeMMO.
3. [Download](../../archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the PokeStrings archive.
4. Copy all of the XML files to `PokeMMO/data/strings`, including the Unova placeholder file. Or, on Android, import the strings in the Client Management menu, importing the Unova placeholder file *first*.
5. **Mac only:** Rename `zz_strings_en_PokeStrings.xml` to `strings-mac.xml`.

## Compatibility with other tools

Compatibility with counters or other external tools is **not guaranteed**. I don't personally use them, as the vast majority of them are Windows-only, and I use Linux as my daily driver instead.

If you'd like to make changes to support other tools, feel free to submit a pull request.
